I have designed and implemented a machine learning model to classify car evaluations using the Roandom Forest Classifier alogorithm. The project involved data preprocessing, including ordinal encoding of categorical variables, training a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluating model performance, achieving [0.94] accuracy in predicting car quality (unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good).
